# Excel VBA Stock Analysis - Student Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Excel VBA Stock Analysis project for Challenge 2! This project is part of my coursework, where I've developed a VBA script to analyze stock data in an Excel worksheet. The script performs various calculations and formatting tasks to provide insights into stock performance.

## Challenge 2 Task

For Challenge 2, I've implemented a VBA script that:

- Writes headers for the data columns.
- Fills symbol summary, calculating yearly change and total stock volume.
- Formats columns and applies conditional formatting to highlight changes.
- Calculates and displays the greatest % increase, % decrease, and total volume.

## Usage

To use the script:

1. Download the Excel workbook containing your stock data.
2. Open the workbook and enable macros.
3. Run the `CalculatorMain` subroutine.
4. The script will iterate through each worksheet, performing analysis and displaying results.

## Files

- `StockAnalysis.vba`: This is the VBA script containing all the necessary code.
- `Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx`: This is a sample Excel workbook containing stock data for testing the script.

## Instructions

1. Download `StockAnalysis.vba` and open it in the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor.
2. Copy the code into a new module in your Excel workbook.
3. Save and close the VBA editor.
4. Open your Excel workbook containing stock data.
5. Run the `CalculatorMain` subroutine.
